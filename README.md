    # MATTERS THAT MUST NEED BEWARE !!  

    ​       **Please make sure you read the following content before browsing the web !**
    
    1. In the login interface, sometimes when you enter the correct account and password and click the login button, the system will display a pop-up window of successful login but does not automatically jump to the page, don't worry, this may be the system network is stuck, at this time click once or several times the login button can be.
    1. Due to restrictions, there are only 10 fixed items to choose from. If you want to add an item, you can only add one of these 10 items(So if you already have 10 items and you want to test the delete add function, you can delete one item before adding it!), and the picture name must match the item name, plus the.png suffix
    1. The email address must be filled in correctly (if it is correct, the message can be successfully sent), otherwise bugs will appear！
    1. Don't worry if you don't get no reaction when you try to modify or delete an item, it's probably due to a foreign key constraint that the item is sitting in your shopping cart or log.
    1. The Alipay account is rjytfm7636@sandbox.com , password is 111111(both interfaces require a password, and the password is 11111)
    1. When using Alipay to pay, do not click anywhere or refresh the screen except for entering the necessary account number and password, otherwise an error will occur!
